excerpt : Pattern recognition and machine learning (PRML) is a very good fundmental tutorial for machine learning beginners like me without any professional supervison. It detailly reveals the basic background, theorical principles, available learning algorithms of different learning approaches, and also with rich visualized descriptions. The abundant academic knowledge definitely shines light on me and drives me to explore practical challenges from statistical angles, other than directly employ certain ML API without realization on the sutiable applications of various methods. This post contains series of notes on different sections after digging and digesting the stuff of PRML. You can also regard it as table of contents and pick out something interesting you.
