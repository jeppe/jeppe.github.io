Selection of suitable evaluation metric plays a significant role in learning best mathmetic model, as well as offering a uniformed approach to measure the performance of the data mining models from different perspectives. This post aims to set up a collection for existing evaluation metrics, which will be organized by the data mining tasks, such as top-k ranking, rating prediction, stability, diversity etc.

### Ranking

_Precision#K_

_Recall#K_

_nDCG_

### Classification

_Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)_ is a graphical plot illustrating the performance of a binary classifier system by plotting the fraction of true positives out of total actual positives (TPR = true positive rate) vs. the fraction of false positives out of total actual negatives (FPR = false positive rate).
